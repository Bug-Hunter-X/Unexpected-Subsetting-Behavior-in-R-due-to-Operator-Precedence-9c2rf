```R
# This code corrects the subsetting issue by using parentheses to explicitly
# group the logical conditions, ensuring the intended order of operations.

df <- data.frame(a = 1:5, b = 6:10)

# Correct subsetting with parentheses to control the order of operations
correct_result <- df[(df$a > 2) & (df$b < 9), ]
print(correct_result)

# Explanation:  Parentheses ensure that `df$a > 2` and `df$b < 9` are evaluated separately
# before the `&` operator combines them. Without parentheses, R's operator
# precedence might lead to unintended results.
